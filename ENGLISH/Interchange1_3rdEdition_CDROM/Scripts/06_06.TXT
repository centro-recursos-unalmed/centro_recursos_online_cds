Unit 6	I like to stay in shape

Mark tries to impress Anne by telling her about his fitness 
routine.

Mark:		Hi there. Nice day, isn't it?

Anne:		Oh, yes, very nice.

Mark:		Do you often come out here this early?

Anne:		Usually. I like to stay in shape.

Mark:		I do too. I usually get up around five o'clock.

Anne:		Oh, really?

Mark:		Yeah. I usually start with some stretches. There's
		a great aerobics program on TV at six.

Anne:		No kidding. I guess you really do like to stay in 
		shape.

Mark:		Hey, three days a week I go straight to my health 
		club after work.

Anne:		Wow. What do you do the other two evenings?

Mark:		Tuesdays and Thursdays, I'm on the old tennis 
		courts by five-thirty.

Anne:		Well, after all that exercise during the week, 
		what do you do over the weekend?

Mark:		Saturdays and Sundays are my days for team sports.

Nancy:		Hi, Anne. Are we late?

Anne:		Oh, no, Nancy. You're . . . right on time. Hi, 
		Terry.

Terry:		Are you ready for a couple more miles?

Anne:		Sure. Say, . . . would you like to join us?

Mark:		Oh, no. . . . Uh, thanks, anyway. I don't have 
		time today. Sorry.

Anne:		OK. Well, bye-bye. Have a nice day!

Mark:		(to new person) Hi there. Nice day, isn't it?
