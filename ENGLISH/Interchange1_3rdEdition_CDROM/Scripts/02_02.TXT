Unit 2	I need a change!

Lynn dreams about a new career.

Paula: 		Hi, Lynn! How are you doing?

Lynn:		Oh, hi, Paula. Pretty good, thanks. How are you?

Paula:		Not bad. Say, you know Bob Wallace, don't you?

Lynn:		Oh, no, I don't think so. Hi, I'm Lynn Parker.

Bob:		Pleased to meet you.

Paula:		So, how's everything?

Lynn:		Do you really want to know?

Paula:		Of course I do.

Lynn:		Well, it's my job.

Paula:		But you have a great job.

Bob:		Where do you work, Lynn?

Lynn:		At AdTech.

Bob:		What kind of business is that?

Lynn:		It's a computer software company.

Bob:		So, what do you do?

Lynn:		I'm a manager in customer service.

Bob:		Well, that sounds interesting.

Lynn:		Well, . . . it is, but I'm at the office ten hours
		a day, six days a week. I'm always on the phone or
		at the computer. I need a change.

Paula:		Well, what do you want to do, Lynn?

Lynn:		Actually, I want to work in a hotel.

Paula:		A hotel?

Lynn:		In fact, I'm studying hotel management.

Paula:		Really?

Lynn:		Yes, I take evening classes.

Paula:		Well, that's great!

Lynn:		And when I finish, I want to find a job in a warm 
		climate.

Bob:		You do? How about a job in Hawaii?

Lynn:		Hawaii?

Bob:		Sure. I have a friend who manages a hotel in 
		Honolulu.

Lynn:		Really?

Bob:		Yeah. Maybe he has a job for you.

Paula:		Hawaii . . . well, that sounds great. . . . Oh, 
		excuse me, I've got to get back to work.

Lynn:		Oh. OK, Paula. Bye.

Bob:		Take it easy, Paula.

Paula:		See you later.

Lynn:		Hawaii . . .
