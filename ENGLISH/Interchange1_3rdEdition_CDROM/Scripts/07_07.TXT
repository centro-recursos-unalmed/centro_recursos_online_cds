Unit 7	How was your trip to San Francisco?

Phyllis tells Yoko about her trip to San Francisco.

Yoko:		Hi, Phyllis.

Phyllis:	Hi, Yoko. How have you been?

Yoko:		Oh, fine. How about you?

Phyllis:	Great! Just great!

Yoko:		So how was your trip to San Francisco?

Phyllis:	Fantastic! We really enjoyed it.

Yoko:		Well, that doesn't surprise me. I love to visit 
		San Francisco. Uh, so, your husband went with you?

Phyllis:	Yes. I worked on Friday, and Bill had business to 
		do in the city too. 

Yoko:		Oh, that's nice. So what did you do over the 
		weekend?

Phyllis:	We went sightseeing together all day Saturday and 
		Sunday morning.

Yoko:		Oh, really? Tell me about it.

Phyllis:	Well, we did a lot of interesting things. 
		Naturally, we started Saturday morning with a ride
		on a cable car.

Yoko:		Naturally. . . . And then?

Phyllis:	Then we went straight to Ghirardelli Square to do 
		some shopping.

Yoko:		Isn't it wonderful? I went there the last time I 
		was in San Francisco.

Phyllis:	Oh, it sure is. We were there for a couple of 
		hours.

Yoko:		Did you buy anything?

Phyllis:	Just some postcards and chocolate. We didn't want 
		to have too much to carry.

Yoko:		What did you do after that?

Phyllis:	We had lunch at a crab stand at Fisherman's Wharf.

Yoko:		Did you visit Alcatraz Island?

Phyllis:	No, we didn't have time.

Yoko:		Oh, . . . what did you do then?

Phyllis:	We took a cab to Golden Gate Park.

Yoko:		Great! Did you see the Japanese Tea Garden?

Phyllis:	Oh, yes, it was really beautiful. . . . But to 
		tell the truth, the thing we liked the best was 
		Chinatown.

Yoko:		Oh, really?

Phyllis:	Yes. We went there on Sunday morning.

Yoko:		What did you like about Chinatown?

Phyllis:	Well, . . . all the people, . . . and the 
		buildings, the shops, and restaurants . . . even 
		the way the streets look. It was just a fascinating
		place. We walked for hours.

Yoko:		I know what you mean. It sounds like you really 
		had fun.

Phyllis:	Oh, we had a great time! So how about you? What 
		did you do over the weekend?

Yoko:		Oh, nothing much. Well, here we are again.

Phyllis:	Oh, back to the real world!
