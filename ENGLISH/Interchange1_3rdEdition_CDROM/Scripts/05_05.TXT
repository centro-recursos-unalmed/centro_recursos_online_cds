Unit 5	A family picnic

Rick invites Betsy to a family picnic.

Betsy:		So, how many people are there in your family, 
		Rick?

Rick:		A lot, if you count all my cousins.

Betsy:		Do they all live here in the States now?

Rick:		Oh, no. I have relatives in Mexico. My grandmother
		and grandfather are there, and my older sister too.

Betsy:		How many sisters do you have?

Rick:		Two, plus an older brother. There's my brother 
		Freddy over there with his wife, Linda.

Betsy:		Oh, really. What do they do?

Rick:		Freddy has an import-export business, and Linda 
		manages a boutique.

Betsy:		Is that their daughter?

Rick:		Yeah. Her name's Angela.

Betsy:		She's cute. How old is she?

Rick:		She's three.

Rick:		Betsy, I'd like you to meet my mother and father.

Betsy:		Pleased to meet you.

Hernandez:	Hi, Betsy.

Mr. 
Hernandez:	Nice to meet you, Betsy.

Betsy:		Hello, Mr. Hernandez.

Rick:		And this is my younger sister Cristina.

Cristina:	Hi, Betsy.

Betsy:		Hi, Cristina.

Rick:		Aunt Marta, this is my friend Betsy Scott, from 
		the night school class.

Betsy:		Hi.

Aunt Marta:	Well, nice to meet you, Betsy. Can you two please 
		come with me? It's time for the family picture.

Rick:		Sure.

Aunt Marta:	Come on, please, everyone!

Betsy:		Can I take the picture for you? Then you can be 
		in it too.

Aunt Marta:	Oh, thank you, Betsy! Now here's the camera. I 
		hope it works OK. It's . . . it's an old one.

Betsy:		Oh, no problem . . . Listen, everybody. I want 
		you to say "cheese" on three. One . . . two . . . 
		three!

Family:		Cheese!
