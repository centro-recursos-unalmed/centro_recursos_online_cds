Unit 4	What kind of movies do you like?

Bill, Alfredo, and Pat try to agree on what they should do 
one evening.

Bill:		So, . . . what do we do now?

Alfredo:	What time is it?

Bill:		Seven o'clock.

Pat:		Look, we all like movies. Why don't we rent a 
		video and watch it at my house?

Bill:		That's not a bad idea, Pat.

Alfredo:	It's OK with me.

Pat:		Well, then, come on! . . . Now here are some 
		great science-fiction movies! What do you think, 
		Bill?

Bill:		Uh, I can't stand sci-fi. How about a good 
		suspense thriller?

Pat:		Uh . . . Alfredo, what about you? What do you 
		think of science fiction?

Alfredo:	Oh, it's OK.

Bill:		Well, what kind of movies do you like?

Alfredo:	I really like classic films a lot.

Pat:		Then come over here. There are some great old 
		horror films here with some of my favorite actors.

Alfredo:	Really? I love horror films!

Bill:		A fifty-year-old movie! Are you kidding?

Pat:		Well, then, how about a western? Do you like 
		westerns?

Bill:		A western?

Alfredo:	Wait a minute. I think I have an answer to our 
		problem.

Pat:		What problem?

Alfredo:	Well, we can't agree on a movie, right?

Bill:		Well . . .

Alfredo:	How about some music? There's a terrific group at 
		the Cafe Solo tonight.

Bill:		Yeah. That sounds good.

Pat:		Sure. Why not?

Alfredo:	Well, then, let's go!

Bill:		So, what's the name of this rock group?

Alfredo:	It's not a rock group. It's a country and western 
		group.

Bill:		Country and western?

Alfredo:	Yeah.

Bill:		Well, gee, I . . . I really don't like country 
		and western very much . . .

Pat:		Isn't there a jazz concert at the City Center 
		tonight?

Bill:		Jazz? Do you really like jazz?
