Unit 9	Help is coming

Sarah and Dave are relaxing at home when they are surprised by 
visitors.

Sarah:		Would you like another cup of coffee?

Dave:		No, thanks. I don't think so.

Sarah:		Is there anything interesting in the paper?

Dave:		Well, there's something about a prison escape.

Sarah:		Oh, really?

Dave:		Yeah. A couple of guys escaped from the state 
		prison in a gray van.

Sarah:		Hmm. . . . Do we know anyone with a minivan?

Dave:		A minivan? What color is it?

Sarah:		I don't know. Light blue, maybe, or gray. I can't 
		see very well.

Dave:		Where is this van?

Sarah:		It's parked right in front of the house. And 
		there are two guys in it.

Dave:		Oh, really?

Sarah:		Now they're getting out of the van.

Dave:		What do they look like?

Sarah:		Well, . . . one man's tall, and I think he has 
		blond hair. He's wearing a baseball cap.

Dave:		How about the other one?

Sarah:		He's . . . short. . . . He's got dark hair. Now 
		they're coming up the driveway.

Dave:		Sarah, you keep watching. I'm going to call the 
		police.

Sarah:		I think that's a good idea.

Dave:		What are they doing now?

Sarah:		They've stopped in the driveway and they're just 
		looking around.

Dave:		About how old are they? Can, can you tell?

Sarah:		Well, the tall one looks like he's about twenty, 
		and I guess the short one's in his late forties. 
		Oh, Dave, now they're coming up to the door. Hurry!

Dave:		It's all right, Sarah. Help is coming.

Sarah:		Wait a minute! I can really see them now. . . . 
		Oh, Dave! . . . The short one is your cousin 
		George.

Dave:		My cousin George!

George:		Dave! So this is the right address. It's been so 
		long since I've seen you, I wasn't sure.

Dave:		George! What on earth are you doing here?

Sarah:		Please, come in!

George:		We were passing through town and decided to stop 
		and say hello. You haven't seen Don here since he 
		was a baby.

Don:		Hi. 

Sarah:		Well, it's great to see you both again. . . . 
		Dave, I think you should make that phone call, 
		don't you?

Dave:		Uh, sure. Please excuse me a minute.

Sarah:		Dave'll be right back. Come in and sit down.
