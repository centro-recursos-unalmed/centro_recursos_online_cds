Unit 10	Sorry I'm late

On his way to meet Marie, Tom has a problem.

Waitress:	Good evening. 

Marie:		Hi. There will be two of us. . . . Thank you. . . .

Tom: 		Marie! I'm really sorry. How long have you been 
		waiting?

Marie:		It's OK, Tom. I've only been here for a little 
		while. Is everything all right?

Tom:		Yes, it is now, but you won't believe what just 
		happened to me.

Marie:		Well, what happened?

Tom:		Well, first of all, I was a little late leaving 
		my apartment, and so I was in a hurry. Then, just 
		after I started the car, I remembered I didn't 
		have any money with me, so I went back to get my 
		wallet.

Marie:		Did you find it?

Tom:		Oh, yes. I found it. That wasn't the problem. 
		The problem was when I got back to my car, I couldn't get in.

Marie:		Do you mean you locked your keys in the car?

Tom:		That's right. So, guess what I did after that!

Marie:		I can't guess.

Tom:		First I tried to call you, but there was no 
		answer. . . . Then I called one of those 
		twenty-four-hour lock services, . . . and they 
		sent a man over to help me.

Marie:		And he opened your car door for you?

Tom:		That's right.

Marie:		How long did it take?

Tom:		About two minutes. So, I paid him and came 
		straight here . . .

Marie:		How much did this cost you?

Tom:		Oh, it wasn't very expensive. It cost only - oh, 
		no!

Marie:		What is it?

Tom:		My wallet! It's still in the car!

Marie:		Oh!

Waitress:	Good evening. Are you ready to order now?

Marie:		Don't worry, Tom. You've had a hard day, and it's 
		my turn to pay, anyway.

Tom:		Thanks.

Marie:		Let's see . . .

Tom:		Well, should we start with an hors d'oeuvre?

Marie:		Hm-hmm.

Tom:		OK.
