Unit 3	At a garage sale

Fred and Susan have different opinions about things at a garage 
sale.

Fred:		Hey, Susan, how do you like this?

Susan:		Oh, please, Fred.

Fred:		Oh, come on. It's only a dollar!

Susan:		Do you really want it, Fred?

Fred:		No, I guess you're right.

Vendor:		Can I help you?

Fred:		No, thanks anyway. We're just looking.

Susan:		Oh, Fred, come over here. Just look at this 
		lovely old necklace!

Fred:		Yeah, it's OK.

Susan:		It's not just OK, Fred. It's very nice! . . . 
		And look at this bracelet. Excuse me, how much 
		are these?

Vendor:		Oh, let's see. How about fifteen dollars for the 
		two of them?

Fred:		Oh, that's not bad.

Susan:		And how much is that old watch?

Vendor:		This one? Oh, this one is, uh, twenty-five 
		dollars.

Fred:		Susan, are you kidding? Twenty-five dollars for 
		that old watch?

Vendor:		This watch is old, but it still runs. Listen!

Susan:		How old is it?

Vendor:		Oh, I don't really know. But it's very old.

Susan:		Oh, it is lovely. . . . I'll take it.

Fred:		OK!

Vendor:		Do you want those too?

Susan:		Yes, I'll take these too.

Vendor's 
husband:	Marge, is that my mother's watch?

Vendor:		What? . . . I don't know!

Vendor's 
husband:	It is my mother's watch! Excuse me, but this watch
		is not for sale. I'm sorry. . . . Marge, could 
		you come over here, please? (to Fred and Susan) 
		I'm sorry.

Fred:		Hey, Susan, look at this!

Susan:		Oh, no, Fred. Not the motorcycle!
