Unit 11	Across the Golden Gate Bridge

Mr. and Mrs. Chang get directions and advice as they rent a car 
at the airport.

Ken:		Good morning. May I help you?

Mr. Chang:	Yes, we're here to pick up a car.

Ken:		Do you have a reservation?

Mr. Chang:	Yes. The name is Chang.

Ken:		OK, Chang, Chang. Here it is, Mr. Chang. Paid in 
		advance. Sign here and here. And that's for one 
		week, then?

Mr. Chang:	That's right. One week.

Ken:		Are you staying in San Francisco?

Mrs. Chang:	No, we're going to visit friends in the Napa 
		Valley.

Ken:		Oh, Napa Valley. That's one of my favorite places.
		The wineries and vineyards there are some of the 
		most famous in California.

Mr. Chang:	What's the best way to get there from here?

Mrs. Chang:	Yes, and are there any interesting places to visit
		along the way?

Ken:		The most interesting way is across the Golden Gate
		Bridge. It's not too crowded this time of day, and
		you can stop in Sausalito for lunch.

Mrs. Chang:	Sausalito?

Ken:		Yes. It's a fascinating little town just across 
		the bridge. You should definitely see it.

Mrs. Chang:	Can you recommend a good restaurant?

Ken:		I really like Houlihan's. It's right on the 
		waterfront, and there's a wonderful view of 
		San Francisco across the bay.

Mr. Chang:	So, Sausalito is on the way to the Napa Valley?

Ken:		Yes, it is. And so is Muir Woods. You should stop 
		there for a while too, if you have time.

Mrs. Chang:	Muir Woods?

Ken:		Yes. It's a beautiful redwood forest. You shouldn't
		miss it.

Mrs. Chang:	Mmm. Sounds interesting.

Mr. Chang:	Well, thank you for the information. We'd better 
		go find our car now.

Ken:		That will be easy. Take the shuttle bus, just 
		outside the door to the right. Here is your 
		contract and directions to help you find the 
		Golden Gate Bridge. Do you need anything else?

Mrs. Chang:	No, we have everything that we need. Thank you so 
		much.

Ken:		OK. Goodbye. See you next week. . . . Oh, and be 
		sure to visit one of the wineries up in Napa 
		Valley.

Mr. Chang:	Thanks. We will.

Mr. Chang:	I just remembered. I don't have a map of the Napa 
		Valley. Maybe I can get one here.

Mrs. Chang:	Don't worry, dear. We can get one in Sausalito 
		after lunch.
