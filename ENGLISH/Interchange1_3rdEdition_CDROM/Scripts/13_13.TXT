Unit 13	At the state fair

Various people enjoy a day at the fair.

Steve:		Oh, corn on the cob, I love that. We always had 
		that at the fair when we were little.

Liz:		We did too.

Vendor 1:	Hey, this is the place! Get your fresh corn on 
		the cob here! Fresh, hot-roasted corn on the cob!
		. . . What would you like?

Steve:		I'll have one of those, please.

Vendor 1:	Coming up. . . . What about you? Would you like 
		one too?

Liz:		Not right now, thank you. I'm not hungry.

Steve:		Maybe you should give us another one, anyway!

Vendor 1:	Sure.

Nancy:		Oh, he is so cute!

Rick:		Yeah, but that was a lot of work. Now let's find a
		place to eat.

Betsy:		How about over there? There's a restaurant where 
		we can sit down too. My feet are tired. . . . You 
		can keep the dog with you.

Rick:		Oh, all right. (to stuffed dog) Come to papa, yeah.
		Aw, good boy. Yuh!

Waitress:	Hi! May I take your order?

Betsy:		Yeah, I think I'll have a hot dog and a small 
		order of french fries.

Waitress:	Would you like anything to drink?

Betsy:		I'll have a small diet cola.

Waitress:	OK. And what can I get for you?

Nancy:		I guess I'd like a salad plate and a cup of tea, 
		please.

Waitress:	What kind of dressing would you like on that?

Nancy:		Do you have Thousand Island?

Waitress:	Yes, we do. Would you like anything else?

Nancy:		No, that'll be all, thanks.

Waitress:	Thank you. And how about you?

Rick:		A hamburger, a large order of fries, and a 
		chocolate milk shake, please.

Waitress:	Anything else?

Rick:		How about something for our little friend?

Paul:		I'm glad that's over.

Cynthia:	I'm hungry. How about you?

Paul:		I don't know. I don't think so.

Cynthia:	Oh, look! They're selling ice cream cones!

Vendor 2:	Hi. What'll you have?

Cynthia:	I'd like a cone, please.

Vendor 2:	How many scoops?

Cynthia:	Three, please.

Paul:		Three scoops?

Cynthia:	Yes, one for me and two for you!

Vendor 2:	Thank you.

Cynthia:	See, I knew you wanted some.
