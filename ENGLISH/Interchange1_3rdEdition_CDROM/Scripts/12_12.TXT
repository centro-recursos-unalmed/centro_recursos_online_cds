Unit 12	Feeling bad

Steve receives various home remedies for his cold from his 
coworkers.

Sandy:		How are those papers coming for this afternoon, 
		Steve?

Steve:		Nearly finished.

Sandy:		Do you still have that cold?

Steve:		Yeah, it's still pretty bad, Sandy.

Sandy:		Listen, I've got just the thing for you. Just a 
		second. . . . Here.

Steve:		What's that?

Sandy:		It's something I picked up at the health-food 
		store. You just mix it with hot water and drink it.

Steve:		But what is it?

Sandy:		I'm not really sure. I think it has ginseng in it 
		or something like that. Try it.

Steve:		Are you sure it works?

Sandy:		Of course it does.

Steve:		Well, thanks, Sandy. That's really nice. Maybe 
		later.

Sandy:		OK. . . . Oh, but don't drive after you take it.

Steve:		Why not?

Sandy:		It makes you sleepy.

Steve:		Sleepy?

Sandy:		Yeah, it's pretty strong medicine.

Jim:		Hey, Steve. Still feeling bad?

Steve:		Yes, it's this terrible cold.

Jim:		No problem. I have something for you.

Steve:		You do? Great.

Jim:		Yeah, it's here in my briefcase. My mom makes it 
		for me when I have a cold.

Steve:		Really?

Jim:		Here it is. Try it.

Steve:		Umm, thanks, Jim. . . . Uh, what is it?

Jim:		It's garlic juice. Actually, it's garlic, onions, 
		and carrots.

Steve:		Great.

Jim:		Drink a cup of this every two hours. It's really 
		great for a cold.

Steve:		I'm sure. Gee, thanks, Jim.

Jim:		Not at all. . . . Hope you feel better.

Steve:		Thanks.

Rebecca:	Well, Steve. How are you feeling now?

Steve:		Oh, about the same, Rebecca.

Rebecca:	Oh. . . . Listen, don't take any of this stuff. 
		I have the best cure of all.

Steve:		You do?

Rebecca:	That's right. I'm taking you out to lunch to a 
		place where they make the best chicken soup in 
		the world.

Steve:		What a good idea.

Rebecca: 	It is. So, come on, let's go.

Steve:		You know, that's the best advice I've had all day,
		Rebecca. Just give me a minute to clean my desk. 
		I'll meet you downstairs, OK?

Rebecca:	OK. See you in a minute.
