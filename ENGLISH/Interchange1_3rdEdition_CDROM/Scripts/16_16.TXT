Unit 16	A whole new Marty

Marty changes his image and makes a new friend.

John:		I'm just terrible at calculus. I don't 
		understand anything in this chapter.

Marty:		I know what you mean. It is a tough 
		course.

John:		Did you figure out the answer to this 
		problem?

Marty:		That's in Chapter 11. I did that 
		last week. Let's see . . . 

Michelle:	Hi, John. I see you're working on 
		calculus.

John:		Oh, hi, Michelle. Yes, I am. Michelle, 
		You know Marty, don't you?

Michelle:	Yeah. Hi, Marty. Say John, I've got a 
		few questions about Chapter 12. Do you
		want to study together?

John:		Well, actually I'm still on Chapter 11.
		But Marty here is working on Chapter 12.

Michelle:	Oh, that's OK. Actually, I've got to go
		to class right now. See you later.

John:		OK, Michelle. See you.

Marty:		Gee, John. How do you do it?

John:		What?

Marty:		Girls. They always talk to you. They 
		never even notice me.

John:		That's not true.

Marty:		Yes, it is. Listen, I need some advice.

John:		Well, maybe you could cut your hair. 
		And your clothes . . . I-I don't know. 
		They could be a little neater.

Marty:		I see what you mean.

John:		You need to be more outgoing. And maybe
		you should exercise. Then you'd have more
		energy.

Marty:		Well, when do we start?

John:		Well, how about right now?

Marty:		OK. Sounds good to me.

		*	*	*

Michelle:	Hi, John. How are you?

John:		Oh, hi, Michelle.

Michelle:	Do you want to study together for this 
		calculus exam?

John:		Well, actually I have to study for my 
		history exam right now. But maybe Marty
		has some time.

Marty:		Hi, Michelle.

Michelle:	Marty?

Marty:		Yeah.

Michelle:	I didn't recognize you! There's something
		different about you. Did you change your 
		hairstyle?

Marty:		Well, it's a little shorter.

Michelle:	Hmm, maybe that's it. Well, anyway, would 
		you like to study for the calculus exam?

Marty:		Sure. No problem. When do you want to start?

Michelle:	How about right now?

Marty:		OK!

John:		It looks like Marty has a new friend.
