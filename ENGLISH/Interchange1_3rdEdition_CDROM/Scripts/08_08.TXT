Unit 8	Are you sure it's all right?

Bill invites two friends to a party and finds out that he has 
made a mistake.

Sandy:		Are you sure it's all right for us to go to the 
		party?

Bill:		Of course I am. Katy's a good friend of mine.

Sandy:		Yes, but she didn't really invite Pat and me, and 
		it is a little late.

Bill:		It's OK, Sandy. It's a very informal party, . . . 
		and anyway she knows both of you already.

Pat:		OK. Well, we're at the corner of 31st Street. Now 
		what?

Bill:		Well, I don't remember her address, but I know she
		lives near here.

Pat:		Fine. But do I go left, right, or straight ahead?

Bill:		Straight ahead. . . . I remember there's a movie 
		theater just before you turn.

Pat:		Hey, is that it?

Bill:		No, I don't think so. . . . There was a coffee 
		shop next door and a drugstore across the street.

Sandy:		Oh, I don't see a drugstore. Well, there's a 
		Vietnamese restaurant . . . with a bookstore next 
		to it.

Pat: 		Yeah, and no coffee shop either. Hey, look! 
		There's another movie theater up ahead on the left.

Bill:		Great! There's a drugstore.

Bill:		We're almost there. . . . Turn left at the corner
		. . . . There's a parking lot just to the 
		left. . . . There it is! 

Pat: 		Great!

Pat:		So where does Katy live?

Bill:		In one of those apartment buildings across the 
		street.

Pat:		Which one?

Bill:		It's the one on the corner.

Sandy:		And you're sure it's all right for us to arrive 
		this late?

Bill:		Come on, Sandy!

Sandy:		I don't hear any music!

Katy:		Bill?

Bill:		Hi, Katy.

Katy:		Hi.

Bill:		Are we too late for the party?

Katy:		Oh, no. . . . Uh, actually, you're a little early.

Bill:		Really?

Katy:		Yes. The party is next Friday.

Bill:		Next Friday?

Katy:		Yes. Hi, Sandy. Pat. Come on in.

Sandy:		I'm sorry, Katy.

Pat:		Are you sure it's all right?

Katy:		No problem. . . . It looks like we have a party 
		here tonight after all.
